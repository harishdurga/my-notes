A class can only have one super class/ parent class. To indicate the relation of the class with more than one class `Composition` will be used.
Ex: A computer contains a monitor, motherboard, casing, keyboard etc. And a motherboard conatins CPU, graphic card, ram etc. So basically with composition we describe the `contains / has` relationship.
