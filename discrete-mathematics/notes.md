# Discrete Mathematics
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.
## Sets
A set is a collection of different elements. Change in the order of elements or repitetion of elements won't change the set.
Ex: set of natural numbers
### Types Of Representations:
#### Roaster or Tabular Representation:
Ex: A={a,e,i,o,u}, B={1,3,5,7,9}
#### Set Builder Representation:
The set is defined by specifying a property that elements of the set have in common.

Ex: A={x:x is a vowel in English alphabet}, B={x:0<x<=9} and x%2 ≠ 0}, C={x:0<x<=10 and x%2==0}

If an element x belongs to a set S the we write as x `x ∈ S` and if x doesn't belong to S then `x ∉ S`.
