# Discrete Mathematics
Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.
## Sets
A set is a collection of different elements. Change in the order of elements or repitetion of elements won't change the set.
Ex: set of natural numbers
### Types Of Representations:
#### Roaster or Tabular Representation:
Ex: A={a,e,i,o,u}, B={1,3,5,7,9}
#### Set Builder Representation:
The set is defined by specifying a property that elements of the set have in common.

Ex: A={x:x is a vowel in English alphabet}, B={x:0<x<=9} and x%2 ≠ 0}, C={x:0<x<=10 and x%2==0}

If an element x belongs to a set S the we write as x `x ∈ S` and if x doesn't belong to S then `x ∉ S`.
#### Cardinality Of A Set:
Also called as `Cardinal number` denoted as `|S|` where S is a set tell the size of the set or number of elements present in the set. 
Example − |{1,4,3,5}| = 4, |{1,2,3,4,5,…}|=∞

#### Injective, Surjective and Bijective Functions:

##### General Function:
If A and B are two sets, not a single element in A is linked to more than one element in B, but one element in B can be linked to many elements in A.
##### Injective Function:
A strict one to one relation between the elements of set A and B.
##### Surjective Function:
All the elements in B are mapped to atleast one element in set A. Not one element is left unmapped.
##### Bijective Funcation:
A function is called bijective if it is both injective and surjective. which means all the elements in set B are mapped and it is a one to one mapping. There can be unmapped elements in A but not in B.
