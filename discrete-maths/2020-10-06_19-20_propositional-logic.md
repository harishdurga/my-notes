# Propositional Logic

#### What is logic?

Logic is the sceince of reasoning. It helps us to explain mathematical statements and approve or disapprove them.
**Ex:** Sum of `n` natural numbers is `n(n+1)/2`

The purpose of logic is to construct valid arguments(Proofs). Once we prove a mathematical statment as `TRUE` then we call it a theorm.

Puzzles like `Famous knights and Knaves` can be easily solved with the help of `Propositional Logic`.

#### What is a Proposition?

It is a declarative statement (a sentence that states a fact or an argument) which can be either TRUE or FALSE and cannot be both.

**Ex:**

- Delhi is the capital of india
- 2+2 = 4

**Not Propositions:**

- What time is it?
- X+1 = 2 (Can be TRUE OR FALSE but we cannot say)

#### What is propositional logic?

It is an area of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying propositions to form more complicated propositions and it also studies the logical relationships and properties derviced from these combined/altered propositions.

**Ex:**
**Statement 1** - It is rainy season.
**Statement 2** - It is rainy season `and` there will be more rains.
Here `It is rainy season` is one proposition and `there will be more rains` is another proposition and we joined these two with a logical connective `and`

Sometimes this is also called `sentential logic` or `statement logic`

#### Why Compound propositions?

Most of the mathematical statements are formed by combining one or more propositions hence the compound propositions.

#### Propositional Variables

Propositional variables represent propositions.
Ex:
**p** = It is rainy season
**q** = There will be more rains.
So the compound proposition will be: `p^q`
