# Introduction

#### What is Discrete Mathematics?

It is a study of discrete objects where discrete means distinct or non related. Discrete maths is not a branch of mathematics but a description for a set of branches which have one thing in common that is discrete.
The mathematics can be divided into discrete and continous.

**Ex:**

- Natural numbers(1,2,3,4....) are discrete and the Real numbers(0.0001,0.00002,0.001 etc) are continous numbers
- Digital clock is discrete in nature and analog clock whose hands sweep smoothly are continous.
