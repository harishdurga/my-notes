1. ```bash
   go fmt ./...
   ```

   This command will format all the files located inside all the folder in the present working directory

2. ### Go Package

   A `Go Package` can be a set of Go source files or Other Packages with the same namespace.

   - Every go file starts with the package namespace statement.
     ```go
        package <packagename>
     ```
     Ex: `main`,`fmt`
   - ##### Notable Advantages:
     1. It reduces naming conflicts. You can have the same function names in different packages.
     2. It speeds up the compilation process by only requiring recompilation of smaller parts of the program that has actually changed. Although we use the fmt package, we donâ€™t need to recompile it every time we change our program.
   - By convention, Executable programs (the ones with the `main` package) are called `Commands`. Others are called simply `Packages`.
