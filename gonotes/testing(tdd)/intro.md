The 4 core values of Agile

- People over tools and processes
- working software rather than prioritizing documentation
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- responding to changes over following a plan

Agile teams are interdisciplinary, including engineers, software testing professionals, product managers, and more.

Agile software delivery methodology focuses on delivering software in small increments or iterations called **sprints**.

##### What is the Difference Between Requirements and Scope?
- **`Requirements`** define the product behavior. They indicate what users want from the product.
- **`Scope`** indicates the activities that need to be done in order to achieve the requirements.
