```
#### Response (Success)

### :information_source:
- Every document will have an `_id` property. If not specified an automatic value will be generated by the ES.
- These is a setting `action.auto_create_index`, if set then an index will be created if it doesn't exist while trying to add the document.
- The `_shards` property contains to how many shards the document has been written and replicated.

### Getting A Document By ID
```bash
GET /<index_name>/_doc/<id>
```
#### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "_index": "products",
  "_id": "sDqUYoIBeKcjnN9MdCUx",
  "_version": 1,
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1,
  "found": true,
  "_source": {
    "name": "Red Marker",
    "price": 250.75,
    "aval_qty": 250,
    "attrs": {
      "color": "red",
      "brand": "Camel",

}
```
#### Response (Not Found):

  "found": false
}
```
### :information_source:
- The response contains additional meta information apart from the document data.
- The actual document will be inside the `_source` property.
- The found property will indicate if a document is found by the id we are trying to fetch with. True if found false otherwise.
