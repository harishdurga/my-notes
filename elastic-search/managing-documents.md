# Managing Documents

### Creating An Index With Default Options
```bash
PUT /<index_name>
```
### Creating An Index With Custom Options
```bash
PUT /<index_name>
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_replicas": 2,
    "number_of_shards": 2
  }
}
```
#### Create Index Response (Success)
```json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "shards_acknowledged": true,
  "index": "<index_name>"
}
```

#### :warning: Elastic search will throw an error when trying create an index which already exists.

### Deleting An Index
```bash
DELETE /<index_name>
```
#### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "acknowledged": true
}
```
#### :warning: Elasticsearch will throw an error when trying to delete an index that doesn't exist.

### Indexing/Adding A Document
```bash
POST /<index_name>/_doc
{
  "name":"Red Marker",
  "price":250.75,
  "aval_qty":250,
  "attrs":{
    "color":"red",
    "brand":"Camel",
    "size":"L"
  }
}
```
#### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "_index": "products",
  "_id": "sDqUYoIBeKcjnN9MdCUx",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```
### :information_source:
- Every document will have an `_id` property. If not specified an automatic value will be generated by the ES.
- These is a setting `action.auto_create_index`, if set then an index will be created if it doesn't exist while trying to add the document.
- The `_shards` property contains to how many shards the document has been written and replicated.

### Getting A Document By ID
```bash
GET /<index_name>/_doc/<id>
```
#### Response (Success)
```json
{
  "_index": "products",
  "_id": "sDqUYoIBeKcjnN9MdCUx",
  "_version": 1,
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1,
  "found": true,
  "_source": {
    "name": "Red Marker",
    "price": 250.75,
    "aval_qty": 250,
    "attrs": {
      "color": "red",
      "brand": "Camel",
      "size": "L"
    }
  }
}
```
#### Response (Not Found):
```json
{
  "_index": "products",
  "_id": "sDqUYoIBeKcjnN9MdCUx1",
  "found": false
}
```
### :information_source:
- The response contains additional meta information apart from the document data.
- The actual document will be inside the `_source` property.
- The found property will indicate if a document is found by the id we are trying to fetch with. True if found false otherwise.

### Updating A Document By ID
```bash
POST /<index_name>/_update/<_id>
{
  "doc":{
    "aval_qty":300,
    "discount":0.0
  }
}
```
#### Response:
```json
{
  "_index": "products",
  "_id": "sDqUYoIBeKcjnN9MdCUx",
  "_version": 2,
  "result": "updated",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 1,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```
### :information_source:
- ES documents are immutable. So how the update is working? ES is not actually updaing the existing document but replacing it with the same `_id`. First the ES will fetch the document into memory and apply the updates and replaces the current one with the updated doc in memory keeping the same `_id`.
- the `result` property from the response informs what operation has happened. **updated**: means the document updated, **noop**: no operation performed.

### Scripted Updates
Sometimes we want to update the document when certain conditions are met, or in other case we want to update the document with reading it first.
```bash
POST /<index_name>/_update/<_id>
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if(ctx._source.aval_qty < 500 ){
        ctx._source.aval_qty += params.add_qty    
      }
    """,
    "params": {
      "add_qty":100
    }
  }
}
```
In the above example we are checking if the available quantity of the product is less than 500, then add additional quantity of 100 to the what ever the value of avilable quantity property. the `ctx` represents the current document in the context.

### Upserts
If ES didn't find a document with the given ID then a new document will be created.
```bash
POST /<index_name>/_update/<_id>
{
  "script": {
    "source": """
      if(ctx._source.aval_qty < 500 ){
        ctx._source.aval_qty += params.add_qty    
      }
    """,
    "params": {
      "add_qty":100
    }
  },
  "upsert": {
    "name":"Blue Marker",
    "price":300,
    "aval_qty":150,
    "attrs":{
      "color":"Blue",
      "brand":"Camel",
      "size":"L"
    }
  }
}
```
If the ES found a document with the given id then the `script` will be executed the result will be `updated`. If a document is not found with the given id then the `upsert` property will be executed and a new document will be indexed. and the result will be `created`.

### Replacing Documents
All the previous data of the document will be replaced by the current data.
```bash
POST /<index_name>/_doc/<_id>
{
  "name":"Red Marker",
  "price":250.75,
  "aval_qty":250,
  "attrs":{
    "color":"red",
    "brand":"Camel",
    "size":"L"
  }
}
```
### Deleting A Document
```bash
DELETE /<index_name/_doc/<_id>
```

## Routing
The process of resolving a shard for a document is called routing.
```
shard_num = hash(_routing) % num_primary_shards
```
This is the routing formula ES uses to determine to/from which shard the document to be stored/read. As this formula depends on the number of shards, it is not allowed to change the number of shards for a given index once it is created as by changing the number of shards it will become difficult to search existing documents. By default ES uses the `_id` as the `_routing`. We can change the routing function but we have to make sure that the function we are writing is distributing documents evenly over all the shards.
